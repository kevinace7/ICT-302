Hello I'm Kev, the picture that you see is Juice WRLD, the reason why he is displayed is because he was one of my favorite artists, I love music (favorite is rap), and I like his style and just streetwear in general. I am a Leo, so birthday just passed, if theres anything to know about me is that I love music and am very interested in streetwear not just wearing it but learning about it as well. I am also a car enthusiast, my favorite brand is BMW, I just love all of the cars in general. But I did grow up around Ford, nothing but Mustangs was what my dad owned.
