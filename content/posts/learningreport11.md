* I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management:
When it came to this week's module I really had to focus on how to identify what these CMS's have, since our subject was about content geography I had to think about who has what and how to talk about these differences in content shapes.
* I can describe and compare content management system:
Since our extra assignment was "Omeka" for this week we got to experiment with that. With that experience I would say that I am glad I am able to look at other CMS's, Omeka was pretty interesting and wasn't so dull like the other ones we are working with. I can see how it is similar to Hugo and Wordpress since they have their "tinks" that they absolutley need in order to post. I also feel like it has the same listing as WordPress when it comes to posted blogs. I can also tell what the differences are when it comes to all three.
* I can manage content using established workflows:
I am admin this week so just had to make sure everything is going according to plan. 
* I can identify and employ technologies related to content management: 
I feel like when it came to Omeka it took a bit but it also kind of reminded me of WordPress which was good. The one thing about Omeka is just it simply has more, you can be more creative with your theme and add more to your post. 
* I can find and use resources for self-directed learning:
I used the discussion posts as best I could to guide me through this week's module.
