* I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management:
I was pretty excited to write discussion posts in this weeks module because I sorta got to talk about YuoTube which is an application I enjoy a lot. There I had to identify how YouTubers use money modeling, which was fun to talk about.
* I can describe and compare content management system:
I don't think we had to use this this much this week since we were mostly talking about ecommerce and talking about what we would use and such.
* I can manage content using established workflows:
Being the editor this week was fun since I got to talk about electric cars and how they are making a scene in the street racing world. We also had to display a menu for this weeks post where we decided on making a menu that shows our posts in order.
* I can identify and employ technologies related to content management: 
When we first started on the menus we just didn't know what we wanted to display that's when we decided we wanted to show our posts from this semester.
* I can find and use resources for self-directed learning:
For this week I mostly used my own knowledge from what I know about cars since I can go on for hours about it.
