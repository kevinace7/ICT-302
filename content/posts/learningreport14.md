* I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management:
I enjoyed talking about the content creators I enjoy watching which I was able to use the same concepts I learned from last weeks discussions. 
* I can describe and compare content management system:
I feel like this is where we got to talk about the different content channels and how they relate and such which is where I talked about YouTube and Patreon and how content creators use them.
* I can manage content using established workflows:
Being the admin this week it was working just as smooth as usual, but we were not able to get in touch about the exta team project which I felt like was a lack of communication on our end. 
* I can identify and employ technologies related to content management:
I was able to talk about these since I had to talk about the channels I wanted to use and how I would use WordPress to display this as well. 
* I can find and use resources for self-directed learning:
I was able to just freely talk about this since I know so much about YouTube and how content creators use this.
