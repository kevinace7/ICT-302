Being able to define web content has been getting easier, I like familiarizing myself with what we've been using the past few weeks.
Comparing and describing has been a lot easier this week too because we've been learning about different types of content which has been helpful to me. 
I am waiting for the time we work on our group project to get familiar with the workflows. 
Employing technologies has been getting easier as time has gone on, identifying is becoming more familiar since we kind of learned that this week. 
Since we had to learn how to do an assignment on our own this week, I believe that we had the correct resources to self direct ourselves into doing the assignments this week.
