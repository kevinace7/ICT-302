This week was learning more about web content which made more sense to me as the week went by. I could say I am learning more about web content and how it is used. Which makes me feel like I can identify it. 
I have been able to compare and describe the web content management systems we've been looking at. 
We are beginning to look at workflows and I am understanding so far on what we have covered. 
Employing technologies onto web content systems has been going well as I see myself preparing these by memory better and better. 
I have been able to use resources for self-directed learning. I will see how this goes when it comes to the group projects.
