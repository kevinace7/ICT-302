Hello this is the luvisrage website which if anyone knows is Lil Uzi Vert inspired. I am a big fan of his, and obviously love is music, style, and such. 
I can define and understand key concepts in web content management, I can do this by explaining how Netlify, and Github are used and how they work together to make this post.
I can identify and employ technologies related to content management, the way I did this is by teacging myself how to create the website name on Github and Netlify. 
I can find and use resources for self-directed learning, I mostly used cnavas and help from our professor to progress my way through this assignment. 
I feel like I am not on the level of being able to compare content management systems just yet. 
I also feel like I can not manage content workflows yet.
