* I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management:
As the semester comes to an end I feel like the time I have spent with this class has taught me a lot about things I really enjoy talking about and watching for my entertainment. It makes me feel like I can have conversations about what I've learned in class. 
* I can describe and compare content management system:
At this point I can totally tell the differences and comparisons between CMS's which I hope I can teach others too. 
* I can manage content using established workflows:
Being an editor this week was pretty enjoyable since it was about another topic I like to discuss. We also had the responsiility to add the plugin to our post as well, which worked out well after having a meeting.  
* I can identify and employ technologies related to content management:
I would say this is where we implemented the calendar/timetable, and employed this plugin as a team. 
* I can find and use resources for self-directed learning:
In order to add the plugin we asked the previous group how they did this task, and they replied and we completed the extra team project.
