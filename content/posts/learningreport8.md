* I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management: 
Being developer this week was kind of a flashback to when I took another ICT class back in the spring semester. So being able to identify certain concepts with using HTML, helped out a lot. Also this week we were looking at other CMS's which also helped me idenify concepts as well
* I can describe and compare content management systems:
This was the week where we were able to look into other CMS's, which was very helpful along with looking at ones I was familiar with already such as Blackboard and Wix. Being able to see the comparisons and differences between all the CMSs we have seen really helped seeing how they can be beneficial for people. 
* I can manage content using established workflows:
With our administrator this week, being able to use workflows has helped us out a lot, by making sure we do what we need to do for this week.
* I can identify and employ technologies related to content management:
Being the developer for the first time this week helped me out a bit since I am not that experienced with coding but HTML is something I am more familiar with. That being said I was able to employ technologies that I really wanted to try this week by changing colors of text, along with the alignment of the text.
* I can find and use resources for self-directed learning:
If there were times I struggled with the HTML I would go back to our post from last week and reference myself on how to do that specific line.
