* I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management:
I felt like I was able to use this this week since we had to look at the differences in schemes for WordPress and Hugo, and we had to identify their layouts and talk about them.
* I can describe and compare content management systems:
This week we had to compare and contrast Hugo and WordPress because of their content modeling. 
* I can manage content using established workflows:
We have made it back to the first rotation of roles as we are back to the roles we first started with in August. 
* I can identify and employ technologies related to content management:
Since being the editor this week I didn't really have to apply much, but we did apply a different type of theme which meant I had to carefully place my paragraphs in the correct section so I didn't mess up the HTML for the developers.
* I can find and use resources for self-directed learning:
I was able to read through the article that we chose and able to write enough about what I wanted to include.
