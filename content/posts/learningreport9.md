* I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management:
I got to have two different roles this week as we had a big week this week as it was our drafts this week. I had to be a developer and editor for this week which wasn't so challenging as I just been implementing what I've learned over the past coursework. 
* I can describe and compare content management systems:
I didn't really have to apply this guideline that much as I just talked about it breifly in my topic for the drafts.
* I can manage content using established workflows:
We decided to keep the same roles as last week since it was just going to be easier. But we were bascially all editors since we needed to write a bit more for our drafts.
* I can identify and employ technologies related to content management:
Being the developer a week longer wasn't so bad since it was just for one of the drafts. 
* I can find and use resources for self-directed learning:
I would reference the blog post I made last week to make the draft for this week.
