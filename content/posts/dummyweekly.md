I'm trying not to, kid. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Don't underestimate the Force. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.

What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.

A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight?

I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.

What!? Red Five standing by. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?

What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.

The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Red Five standing by. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. You don't believe in the Force, do you? I call it luck.

Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.

Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. You mean it controls your actions? I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.

Partially, but it also obeys your commands. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?
