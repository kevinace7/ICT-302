* I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management:
For this week we were introduced to WordPress which made us understand the whole concept of content managment all together since we had to work as a group. Being able to talk to my classmates about using certain elements within our post made the big jump in my opinion. Since we were using GitHub at first to make our changes/posts now we had to jump to WordPress for that.
* I can describe and compare content management systems:
Seeing the difference between Hugo and WordPress really helped since they are pretty different when it comes to making changes. So being able to idenify the differences and similarities between them made it a lot easier to understand.
* I can manage content using established workflows:
Now this was the first group project we had and I would say it went pretty well for us as we all communicated for what topic we wanted and such. We also talked about how we want the design of our post to look like and such. 
* I can identify and employ technologies related to content management:
Using WordPress was a lot easier to use since everything you need is right there in front of us which is a lot more convenient than making changes with Hugo.
* I can find and use resources for self-directed learning:
While on the Explore assignment of the class I would say this was the self-directed learning portion of learning how to use WordPress which helped out in the end after seeing the final product of ours and looking at other groups post.
