I feel like after this week I am able to understand the concepts we have learned in class. With that I feel I can identify more concepts and talk about content management. 
After looking at more systems I think I can describe what they are, when it comes to comparing I think I'll need more work on it. 
This week was a lot better with experience as I was able to change more of my website which was pretty fun. 
Employing and identifying these technologies is getting a lot better since now I am learning what code goes where and such.
I am able to find resources on the projects we've been doing so far, along with the directions thats on the assignment page on canvas.
