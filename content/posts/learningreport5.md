* I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management:
For this week I have a even better understanding when it comes to key concepts, since this week we learned presemtation and content. When it came to presentation it's all about designs, and the aesthetic of a figure. When it's content it's about what you are going to gain from the oragnization by looking into them. 
* I can describe and compare content management systems.
I think when it came to this weeks lesson it was more about identifying what is more for show and what can actually make someone interested in what they are showing to their audience. 
*I can manage content using established workflows.
I think this came more into place this week since you really had to be careful with what you are doing when adding a theme. Since there are somewhat major and minor steps within this process, I would say it helped me more learning how to manage.
* I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
This was the big one for me this week since I attempted to get the theme that I wanted, after trying with three different themes I decided that the ones I liked just couldn't work with the hugo coding and such. 
* I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
I was able to learn how to change the color of the m10 theme which made me feel a lot better about using it, along with being able to follow the professsor's instructions on canvas.
