* I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management:
For this week's module I actually found it interesting to look into plug-ins. They showed me basically mini-apps that I was able to identify how they work and such. 
* I can describe and compare content management system:
With the extra assignment we had this week it was looking into the WordPress widgets which was honestly really cool and didn't realize they had. With that in mind I think that just makes more of a case for me to compare and contrast CMS's.
* I can manage content using established workflows: 
I have the developer role this week so there has been more of a responsibility this week to make this post more presentable since we have been making our posts look better time after time. 
* I can identify and employ technologies related to content management: 
With being developer this week I try to find resources that I feel like can make the posts look unique with the colors and stuff. 
* I can find and use resources for self-directed learning:
I usually reference blogs we previously posted.
