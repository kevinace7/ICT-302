* I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management:
For this week I feel it was somewhat the same as last week since I felt like we were comparing different CMS's still which was still the case. Along with looking back at previous module terms, we used those to talk about what kind of CMS's we prefer. 
* I can describe and compare content management systems:
With this week, there was more depth looking into the CMS's as we compared and contrasted Hugo and WordPress which made it a lot more simple to see the differences along with similarities. 
* I can manage content using established workflows:
Being the administrator this week, was pretty fun to me as I was able to help others and just do a full on report about how we created our posts. I feel like it gives a behind the scenes feel to it. I liked being able to analyze what we did and put it into words. 
* I can identify and employ technologies related to content management:
This week I didn't really have to employ technologies on WordPress, other than employing technologies on here.
* I can find and use resources for self-directed learning:
Being the administrator this week, I felt it was pretty self explanatory to know what I needed to do.
